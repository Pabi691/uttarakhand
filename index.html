<p>Facts about Uttarakhand – Uttarakhand, earlier known as

  is a great pilgrimage centre and it is a major destination
  for Hindu Temples. It came into existence 9th November 2000.

   foothills of the Himalayas, the State has international boundaries with China

Uttarakhand’s name is derived from the
Sanskrit words Uttara (उत्तर) meaning ‘north’, and khaṇḍa (खण्ड) meaning ‘land’,
altogether simply meaning ‘Northern Land’. The name finds mention
in early Hindu scriptures as the combined region of “Kedarkhand” (present day Garhwal)
and “Manaskhand” (present-day Kumaon).</p>
<p>There are 13 districts in Uttarakhand which are grouped into two divisions,
  Kumaon and Garhwal. Four new districts named Didihat, Ranikhet, Kotdwar, and Yamunotri were
  declared by the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, Ramesh Pokhriyal, on 15 August 2011 but yet to be officially formed.</p>
